## Abstract
The unchecked spreading of fake news is an alarming phenomenon on every social media platform and information outlet. Since online content can have a decisive effect on users’ political, social and business decisions and opinions, the identification and elimination of false information has become a critical prerogative for many online companies.
Natural language processing (NLP) encompasses linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence. The main application of NLP is to train algorithms to analyze texts and extrapolated actionable insights based on text’s word composition and frequency. Another way of examining a document is analyzing the document’s intrinsic complexity. Text complexity is measured by several linguistic indexes such as Flesch Kincaid and Coleman Liau indexes.
Herein, I tested several machine learning models that leverage NLP techniques, linguistic indexes or both, to predict the news’ truthiness. The best model I built was able to discriminate real from fake news with a balanced accuracy of 0.9779 and AUC score of 0.9992.
